# React Redux Weather app

## Summary

A react redux weather app which will display data from the [Open Meteo Weather API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) using a dynamic modern front end built in React / Redux-toolkit.

This weather app greatly improves upon my last attempt by encorporating a different technology stack:
- TypeScript replaces JavaScript.
- React replaces plain HTML / JavaScript.
- Redux-toolkit for state management.
- A mixture of Material UI library alongside plain CSS.

## Run locally

In console run the command `npm i` then `npm run start`.
